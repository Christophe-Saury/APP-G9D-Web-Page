# APP-G9D-Web-Page
School Project composed of an electronic and an informatic part. 
Part 1 : Making of sensors to be placed on a worksite       
Part 2 : Making of a web site that can showcase the results and manage the workers of a company. A more exhaustive description is in the README file.

This school project was made in groups of 6. The goal of this project was to invent a company that would sell sensors. These sensors should be able to read the 
ambiant temperature, the humidity of the air, the ambiant noise and detect the pulse of a person.
We were free to decide on the name of our company and of our product, we were also able to choose which sector we wanted to operate in.
We decided to make sensors that would be sold to construction companies to be placed throughout the construction site.

The website would be used by the construction company to manage it's worksites. The website was made to allow the company to have multiple work sites at the same time, 
assign personnel to each construction sites, show the temperature, humidity and noise for each worksite. Show the time under stress for a worker wearing the cardiac 
sensor. The website assigns a danger level in case of a noise, temperature or heart frequence that has a too high value and lasts for too long. The website also 
includes a quiz that users have to take to get familiarized with safety regulations.


Part 1 : Making if the sensor :
Details for this part of the project may be added at a later date 


Part 2 : The Web Site

The requirements for the website were the following :
- Have an authentification system with the possibility to log in as a user, manager or administrator
- Have an inscription system for each user
- The users have to be able to edit their profile
- Manage access rights
- Show the sensor values
- The manager can find a user through a simple search (one criteria search)
- Return a search result in the form of a table
- Can contact the administrator by mail from the website
- Can consult the legal mentions and terms of use
- Can manage users (add, modify, delete, show)
- Manage an FAQ

Functionalities we added :
- Ticketing function to notify the administrator about problems on the website
- A quiz for the workers to familiarize themselve with the safety regulations (includes a score being handed out and a leaderboard actualized everyday)
- Ability for the user to see all of the scores he had for the day
- Ability for the manager to see the scores of all the workers for any given day and sort the results by score
- Showing of the worksites on an interactive map
- Being able to set multiples worksites instead of just one
- Showing an error page when there are problems with the database or code (not 100% deployed yet)
- Is protected from javascript injections when the user can insert text into text fields (example : when he edits his info)
- Hashes the passwords for every user

Functionalities to add in the future : 
- Being able to show an english version of the website through the click of a button
- Add more security features like rewriting the url to avoid the injection of code into the parameters of the link
